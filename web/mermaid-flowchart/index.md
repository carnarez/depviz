Stick your data below. Expected in either the CSV format (each line carrying a pair of
`parent,child` or `child,parent`; check the right button below) or JSON (each key being
a parent and corresponding value an array of children
`{parent: [child, child, ...], parent: [...]}`, or a child and corresponding value an
array of parents `{child: [parent, parent, ...], child: [...]}`). Keep it consistent, no
mixing between these formats. Diagram orientation can be selected using the arrow (click
on your choice).

You have to keep it reasonable in term of number of objects (_aka_ nodes) involved or the
diagram will be unreadable.
